# Kampala-City-routes---Shortest-path



Find Shortest -routes in your city

This code finds the shortest path between two places.

Usage
To use the code, you will need to first create a graph object. You can do this by creating a new instance of the Graph class. Once you have created a graph object, you can add nodes and edges to it. To add a node, you can use the add_node method. To add an edge, you can use the add_edge method.

Once you have added nodes and edges to your graph, you can find the shortest path between two places using the find_shortest_path_dfs function. The find_shortest_path_dfs function takes two arguments: the start node and the end node. The function returns a list of nodes representing the shortest path from the start node to the end node.

Example
The following example shows how to use the code to find the shortest path from node A to node C:

import find_shortest_path_dfs

graph = find_shortest_path_dfs.Graph()

Add some nodes to the graph.
graph.add_node("A")
graph.add_node("B")
graph.add_node("C")

Add some edges to the graph.
graph.add_edge("A", "B")
graph.add_edge("B", "C")

Find the shortest path from A to C.
path = find_shortest_path_dfs.find_shortest_path_dfs(graph, "A", "C")

Print the path.
print(path)
